# Calculator---Hardcoded
This is by far the most work I have done in a project. "BETA" is the first version of the program, got some bugs on it, the normal file is, for now, the final version. I did in the worst way possible without using libraries or tutorials (for the programming part), for the UI I follow a youtube tutorial: https://youtu.be/BuZtAqk5LIY
